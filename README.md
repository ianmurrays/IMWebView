# IMWebView

IMWebView is a set of utilities inspired by PhantomJS, allowing you to interact with websites programatically.

## How do I even?

Just add `IMWebView.h` and `IMWebView.m` to your project, and make sure you add `document-readiness.js` and `inject-jquery.js` to your bundle as well.

No examples for now, but the header file should explain enough.
